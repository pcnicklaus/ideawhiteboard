Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy ideawhiteboard.co. It was my first project in the world of coding and I think it's pretty cool!

Please, please, please send me any thoughts, suggestions, revisions, etc. But also remember, I'm just starting out so don't go to technical quite yet. I really want to learn though so if you do, just be willing to answer some questions and provide some guidance.

Again, thanks for looking and I wish you all the best!
